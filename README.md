Code completed for Cogrammer

web-shop is a demo for login, routes and conditional display
To run "npm install" it's dependencies then "npm start"

carInventory show cases a minimal MERN fullstack application able to take inputs and store them in MongoDB
To run "npm install" in both folders. Then "npm start" in carBackend to run the it's script and in car-inventory "npm start" again
Upate functionality to be added and the app to be turned fully into React components.
NOTE The .env file has been left so others can see that information is being passed from front to back end and finally the DB. The password it is used for accesses nothing sensitive on that cluster.
NOTE If using a vpn you may have to disable it as I found it can prevent the carBackend from connecting to the DB and cause a timeout error
